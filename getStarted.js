// Declare and assign values to 3 variables using each of the following keywords let, const, and var.

// Use console.log() to display the value of the variables in the browser's console.

// Change the value of the variables declared with the let and var. Print their new value to the console with console.log()

// What happens if you try to change the value of the variable declared with the const and print its new value to the console?

// Why might you choose to use the const keyword? because you don't want something to change

// What is one reason it not best practice to use the var keyword? - code executes top to bottom - no error in console - undefined

// Variables cannot begin with a number

let fname = "jake",
    discount = true;
const age = 49;

    console.log(fname);
    console.log(discount)
    console.log(age)
